# Supervised_ML(Score Prediction Task) 

# Simple Linear Regression Model Building 

The task is to predict the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours.

Since, there are only two variables: 
- Dependent Variable: Score 
- Independent Variable: Hours spent on studying
This model building is called as Simple Linear Regression.

This walk-flow contains the following steps: 
- 1. Library Handling 
- 2. Loading & Analysing data
- 3. Exploratory Data Analysis 
- 4. Data Preparation for Model building 
- 5. Building the Linear Model 
- 6. Prediction on Test Data Sets
